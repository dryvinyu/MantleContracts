# Change: Update UI Redesign (Dark Pro + Futuristic Blue)

## Why
The current UI is visually inconsistent and does not match the desired premium, professional feel for a RealFi console. A cohesive dark theme with futuristic accents will improve perceived quality and readability for data-heavy screens.

## What Changes
- Apply a unified dark professional theme with a blue accent system across all pages.
- Redesign core layout patterns (shell, cards, tables, charts, modals) for consistency.
- Improve typography hierarchy and spacing for data-dense UI.
- Update background treatments and subtle motion to reinforce the futuristic tone.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `ui` (new capability spec)
- Affected code: `app/`, `components/`, `app/globals.css`, `tailwind.config.js`, shared UI components
